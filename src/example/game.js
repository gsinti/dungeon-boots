				Barret Boulderfist is the bane of all monsters, an axe-wielding one man army who
				fights without mercy. He's purged a hundred dungeons full of vile horrors, and has no fear that
				any enemy can match his brutal prowess in combat. A consummate professional, he takes great
				pride in his work, and he enjoys it too - after all, these dungeons need to be cleared,
				and nobody can do it better than him.

				moment seems worthy, chooses to play a part in their stories.
